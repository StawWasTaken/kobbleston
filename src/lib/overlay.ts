 * Marks that sit on top of a picture.

 * A picture can be any colour and so can the page, so these are built out of
 * the theme's own card colour rather than out of black: in the dark they are
 * dark, in the light they are light, and either way a blur and a hairline
 * edge keep them legible over whatever is underneath. A black pill on a light
 * page reads as a hole punched in it.
