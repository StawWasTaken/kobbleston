# Kobbleston

> Pixels go brrr

Kobbleston is a social platform for making little corners of the internet.
People build **Spaces**, publish them, and visit each other's.

Built by Staw.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # already filled in with the publishable key
npm run dev
```

`npm run build` typechecks and builds to `dist/`.

## Deploying

GitHub Pages publishes this repository's root from `main`, so the built site
is committed there: `index.html`, `404.html`, `assets/` and `brand/`. The
`Build site` workflow rebuilds and commits them on every push, so you do not
have to remember. To do it by hand:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Because the built `index.html` lives at the root, the document Vite builds
*from* is `app.html`. That is the only reason it is named that way. `404.html`
is the same document again: Pages has no rewrites, so it is what hands a deep
link like `/discover` to the router.

Pages serves the repo from `/kobbleston/`, so `vite.config.ts` sets that as
the base path, the router picks it up through `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, and
files in `public/` are referenced through the `asset()` helper rather than a
leading slash. Deploying to a domain root instead is one change: build with
`VITE_BASE=/`.

## The database

Supabase backs everything. Apply the four migrations in `supabase/migrations`
in order from the Supabase SQL editor before running the app, see
[`supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md).

Only the publishable key ever reaches the browser. Every counter the platform
shows (visits, updates, accounts) is computed server-side by a `security
definer` function, and row level security means a query from the client can
only ever return what that person is allowed to see.

## Design notes

- `#1B34E8` is the brand and the interaction colour. `#162382` is the sidebar.
  `#101012` is everything behind it.
- `#1CAE71` means one thing only: a Space. Entering one, being inside one.
  Presence on the platform itself is blue; offline is grey.
- Headings are BD Gravel-VF, loaded from Typekit and set at `ROND 100`.
- Icons are filled Font Awesome, no exceptions.
- Kobby appears in empty states, notifications, errors and 404s, moments,
  not decoration.
- Everything animated respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Kobbleston Create

The creator marketplace at `/create`. People upload images, audio, video,
fonts and models; everything enters a review queue and stays private to its
uploader until it is approved. Uploads by the Kobbleston account carry a
verified mark. See [`supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md) for how review
is wired and what still needs deploying.

## What is in here

- **Spaces** with badges their owner designs, favourites, likes and visits.
- **Communities** people create and join.
- **Kobbleston Create**, the reviewed marketplace of uploads.
- **Pixels**, the platform currency, with a ledger behind every balance.
- **Guest mode**, a throwaway account for looking around.
- **Chat** as a dock in the corner, a chat inside every Space that its owner
  can shape or switch off, and friends, follows and notifications.
- **Automated review** of usernames, Space text, uploads and messages, which
  decides as things are submitted rather than queueing them.
- **Account switching** between accounts used on this device.

## Not built yet

The Kobbleston editor (building the inside of a Space) is deliberately out of
scope for now, and the UI says so where it would otherwise be a dead end
rather than pretending it exists.

Content review is a rule based filter, not a model. It catches the obvious
cases and the common ways around them; it is not a substitute for people
reporting things.

Ads are not built. When they are, the share owed to the person whose Space
shows one is 15 percent, and `pixel_transactions` already has the shape to
record it.

Badges are awarded by the Space owner rather than by the Space itself, because
there is no editor yet for a Space to award them from.
