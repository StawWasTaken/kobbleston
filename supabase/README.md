# Kobbleston database

Supabase project: `https://sdnjdgeqrhzkyfyohcsz.supabase.co`

Apply the migrations in order from the SQL editor (or `supabase db push`).
They are re-runnable: every step checks for itself first, so a run that fails
part way can simply be run again once the cause is fixed.

1. `0001_init.sql` - tables and indexes
2. `0002_policies.sql` - row level security
3. `0003_functions.sql` - triggers and RPCs
4. `0004_realtime.sql` - realtime publication
5. `0005_accounts_and_create.sql` - signup fields and the Create marketplace
6. `0006_storage_and_review.sql` - the uploads bucket and the review pipeline
7. `0007_avatars.sql` - the profile picture bucket
8. `0008_badges_communities_pixels.sql` - badges, Communities, follows, favourites, Pixels
9. `0009_guests_and_views.sql` - guest accounts and the profile and Space reads
10. `0010_fix_publish_event.sql` - fixes the publish announcement
11. `0011_automated_review.sql` - the automated content filter
12. `0012_space_chat.sql` - the chat that comes with every Space
13. `0013_guest_limits.sql` - what a guest may and may not do
14. `0014_group_chats.sql` - named group conversations

Notes:

- Profiles are created automatically by the `on_auth_user_created` trigger, so
  the client never inserts one.
- Visit counts only move through `enter_space()`, which records at most one
  visit per person per space per hour. There is no client-writable counter.
- `platform_stats()` and `recent_activity()` are the only things the
  logged-out landing page reads, and both are exposed to `anon`.
- Only the publishable key belongs in the frontend. The service role key must
  never leave the Supabase dashboard.

## The Kobbleston account

Kobbleston's own uploads show a verified mark in Create. After signing that
account up normally, mark it once:

```sql
update public.profiles set is_admin = true, is_moderator = true
 where lower(username) = 'kobbleston';
```

`list_assets()` sorts admin uploads first and returns `creator_is_admin`, which
is what the verified mark reads.

## Reviewing uploads

Uploads land in `public.assets` with `status = 'pending'`. Nothing reachable
from the browser can change a status: `assets_update_own_metadata` only lets a
creator rename their own row while it is still pending, and `review_asset()`
has execute revoked from `anon` and `authenticated`. Until something approves
an upload, only its creator can see it.

Approving happens outside the database, from a worker holding the service
role key, which is the only place that key may ever live:

```sql
select public.review_asset('<asset id>', 'approved');
select public.review_asset('<asset id>', 'rejected', 'Not your artwork.');
```

Point that worker at whatever automated check you want to run first, and have
it call `review_asset` with the outcome. A signed-in moderator (a profile with
`is_moderator`) can read the backlog through `review_queue()` and make the same
calls by hand. Until a worker is deployed, uploads simply stay pending and
invisible, which is the safe failure.

## The Kobbleston account

Kobbleston's own uploads show a verified mark in Create. After signing that
account up normally, mark it once:

```sql
update public.profiles set is_admin = true, is_moderator = true
 where lower(username) = 'kobbleston';
```

`list_assets()` sorts admin uploads first and returns `creator_is_admin`, which
is what the verified mark reads.

## Automated review

`0011_automated_review.sql` decides things as they are submitted, so nothing
waits in a queue for a worker that may not exist. To be clear about what it
is: a deterministic filter, not a model. It is a term list in
`public.moderation_terms` plus pattern rules, run against text that has first
been flattened by `normalize_for_screening()`, which undoes letter for number
substitutions, collapses repeated letters and strips padding characters, so
`f&u.c.k` and `fuuuuck` are caught alongside the plain spelling.

`screen_text()` returns `ok`, `review` or `block` and the reason. It runs on:

- **usernames, display names and bios**, through the `profiles_screen`
  trigger. `check_username()` gives the signup form the same answer while
  someone is still typing, including whether the name is taken.
- **Space names and descriptions**, through `spaces_screen`.
- **uploads**, through `assets_review`, which also checks the file extension
  matches the kind claimed. Admin uploads skip the check entirely and go
  straight to approved. Everything else is approved, rejected with a reason,
  or left pending when the filter is unsure, which is the only case a person
  sees.
- **messages**, both direct and in a Space.

Tune it by editing the table, not the code:

```sql
insert into public.moderation_terms (pattern, decision, reason)
values ('(^|[^a-z])sometermhere', 'block', 'Why it is blocked');
```

A signed-in moderator can still read the backlog through `review_queue()` and
decide by hand with `review_asset()`, which remains revoked from `anon` and
`authenticated` and is meant for a worker holding the service role key.

## Logging in with a username

Supabase signs people in with an email, so `supabase/functions/login` turns a
username into one behind the service role key. Doing that lookup in the
browser would hand anyone who knows a username the address behind it, so it
does not happen there. Deploy it before anyone tries to log in:

```bash
supabase functions deploy login
```

It answers the same way whether a username does not exist or the password is
wrong, so it cannot be used to find out which names are real. An email typed
into the username box still works.

## Guests

Guest mode uses Supabase anonymous sign-in, so turn on
**Authentication -> Sign In / Providers -> Anonymous sign-ins**. Without it the
"Play as Guest" button reports that guest mode is not switched on, rather than
pretending to work.

A guest is a real account with `is_guest` set, so presence, entering a Space
and looking around behave normally. What a guest cannot do is enforced by
policy in `0013_guest_limits.sql`, not by hiding buttons: no making Spaces,
Communities or uploads, no likes, favourites, follows or friend requests, no
messages anywhere, and no renaming itself into something that looks like a
real account. Guests get no Pixels and stay out of the public counts.

Two more caps on churn: no more than 200 guests may join in an hour, and
`sweep_guests()` deletes guests not seen for a day. Point a scheduled job at
that function, or run it by hand:

```sql
select public.sweep_guests();
```

## Pixels

Pixels are the platform currency. A balance on `profiles` is never written
from the browser: `move_pixels()` is the only way it changes, it has execute
revoked from `anon` and `authenticated`, and every movement writes a row to
`pixel_transactions`, so the ledger and the balance cannot disagree. New
accounts are granted 100 by trigger.

To hand out Pixels from a worker holding the service role key:

```sql
select public.move_pixels('<user id>', 500, 'admin', 'Contest prize');
```

## Badges

A Space owner creates badges on their own Space. Awarding goes through
`award_badge()`, which checks the caller owns the Space, refuses duplicates,
and keeps `awarded_count` in step with the awards. Nothing writes
`badge_awards` directly. Automatic awarding from inside a Space arrives with
the editor; until then an owner awards them deliberately.

## Space chat

Every Space has a chat. Its owner sets `chat_enabled`, `chat_greeting` and
`chat_slowmode_seconds` on the Space itself. Sending is gated by policy on
those columns, and `space_messages_screen` enforces slow mode and runs the
same filter as everything else before a message is stored. The owner can
clear anything said in their Space.

## Group chats

`create_group_conversation(title, members)` makes a named conversation with up
to five friends. Everyone added has to already be a friend, checked in the
function, so a group cannot be used to reach strangers. `my_conversations()`
returns everything the chat dock shows, including unread counts and who is in
each conversation, in one read.
